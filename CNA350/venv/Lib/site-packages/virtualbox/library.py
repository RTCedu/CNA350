__doc__ = """\
  Welcome to the **VirtualBox Main API documentation**. This documentation
describes the so-called *VirtualBox Main API* which comprises all public
COM interfaces and components provided by the VirtualBox server and by the
VirtualBox client library.

VirtualBox employs a client-server design, meaning that whenever any part of
VirtualBox is running -- be it the Qt GUI, the VBoxManage command-line
interface or any virtual machine --, a dedicated server process named
VBoxSVC runs in the background. This allows multiple processes working with
VirtualBox to cooperate without conflicts. These processes communicate to each
other using inter-process communication facilities provided by the COM
implementation of the host computer.

On Windows platforms, the VirtualBox Main API uses Microsoft COM, a native COM
implementation. On all other platforms, Mozilla XPCOM, an open-source COM
implementation, is used.

All the parts that a typical VirtualBox user interacts with (the Qt GUI
and the VBoxManage command-line interface) are technically
front-ends to the Main API and only use the interfaces that are documented
in this Main API documentation. This ensures that, with any given release
version of VirtualBox, all capabilities of the product that could be useful
to an external client program are always exposed by way of this API.

The VirtualBox Main API (also called the *VirtualBox COM library*)
contains two public component classes:
:py:class:`IVirtualBox` and :py:class:`ISession`, which
implement IVirtualBox and ISession interfaces respectively. These two classes
are of supreme importance and will be needed in order for any front-end
program to do anything useful. It is recommended to read the documentation of
the mentioned interfaces first.

The :py:class:`IVirtualBox` class is a singleton. This means that
there can be only one object of this class on the local machine at any given
time. This object is a parent of many other objects in the VirtualBox COM
library and lives in the VBoxSVC process. In fact, when you create an instance
of the :py:class:`IVirtualBox`, the COM subsystem checks if the VBoxSVC
process is already running, starts it if not, and returns you a reference to
the VirtualBox object created in this process. When the last reference
to this object is released, the VBoxSVC process ends (with a 5 second delay to
protect from too frequent restarts).

The :py:class:`ISession` class is a regular component. You can create
as many Session objects as you need but all of them will live in a
process which issues the object instantiation call. Session objects
represent virtual machine sessions which are used to configure virtual
machines and control their execution.

The naming of methods and attributes is very clearly defined: they all start
with a lowercase letter (except if they start with an acronym), and are using
CamelCase style otherwise. This naming only applies to the IDL description,
and is modified by the various language bindings (some convert the first
character to upper case, some not). See the SDK reference for more details
about how to call a method or attribute from a specific programming language.

    Note that states to the right from PoweredOff, Aborted and Saved in the
    above diagram are called *online VM states*. These states
    represent the virtual machine which is being executed in a dedicated
    process (usually with a GUI window attached to it where you can see the
    activity of the virtual machine and interact with it). There are two
    special pseudo-states, FirstOnline and LastOnline, that can be used in
    relational expressions to detect if the given machine state is online or
    not:
    
    
    ::

         if (machine.GetState() >= MachineState_FirstOnline &&
         machine.GetState() <= MachineState_LastOnline)
         {
         ...the machine is being executed...
         }


    
    When the virtual machine is in one of the online VM states (that is, being
    executed), only a few machine settings can be modified. Methods working
    with such settings contain an explicit note about that. An attempt to
    change any other setting or perform a modifying operation during this time
    will result in the @c VBOX_E_INVALID_VM_STATE error.
    
    All online states except Running, Paused and Stuck are transitional: they
    represent temporary conditions of the virtual machine that will last as
    long as the operation that initiated such a condition.
    
    The Stuck state is a special case. It means that execution of the machine
    has reached the "Guru Meditation" condition. This condition indicates an
    internal VMM (virtual machine manager) failure which may happen as a
    result of either an unhandled low-level virtual hardware exception or one
    of the recompiler exceptions (such as the *too-many-traps*
    condition).
    
    Note also that any online VM state may transit to the Aborted state. This
    happens if the process that is executing the virtual machine terminates
    unexpectedly (for example, crashes). Other than that, the Aborted state is
    equivalent to PoweredOff.
    
    There are also a few additional state diagrams that do not deal with
    virtual machine execution and therefore are shown separately. The states
    shown on these diagrams are called *offline VM states* (this includes
    PoweredOff, Aborted and Saved too).
    
    The first diagram shows what happens when a lengthy setup operation is
    being executed (such as :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` ).
    
    
    ::

         +----------------------------------(same state as before the call)------+
         |                                                                       |
         +-> PoweredOff --+                                                      |

         |                |
         +-> Saved -------+


    
    The next two diagrams demonstrate the process of taking a snapshot of a
    powered off virtual machine, restoring the state to that as of a snapshot
    or deleting a snapshot, respectively.
    
    
    ::

    For whoever decides to touch this enum: In order to keep the
    comparisons involving FirstOnline and LastOnline pseudo-states valid,
    the numeric values of these states must be correspondingly updated if
    needed: for any online VM state, the condition
    FirstOnline <= state <= LastOnline must be
    @c true. The same relates to transient states for which
    the condition FirstOnline <= state <= LastOnline must be
    @c true.


    .. describe:: null(0)

            Null value (never used by the API).

    .. describe:: powered_off(1)

            either never been started or been shut down successfully.

    .. describe:: saved(2)

            The machine is not currently running, but the execution state of the machine

            it can be resumed.

            The machine was teleported to a different host (or process) and then
            powered off. Take care when powering it on again may corrupt resources
            it shares with the teleportation target (e.g. disk and network).

    .. describe:: aborted(4)

            The process running the machine has terminated abnormally. This may
            indicate a crash of the VM process in host execution context, or
            the VM process has been terminated externally.

            The machine is currently being executed.
            
            For whoever decides to touch this enum: In order to keep the
            comparisons in the old source code valid, this state must immediately
            precede the Paused state.
            
            @todo Lift this spectacularly wonderful restriction.

    .. describe:: paused(6)

            Execution of the machine has been paused.
            
            For whoever decides to touch this enum: In order to keep the
            comparisons in the old source code valid, this state must immediately
            follow the Running state.
            
            @todo Lift this spectacularly wonderful restriction.

    .. describe:: stuck(7)

            Execution of the machine has reached the "Guru Meditation"
            condition. This indicates a severe error in the hypervisor itself.
            
            bird: Why this uncool name? Could we rename it to "GuruMeditation" or
            "Guru", perhaps? Or are there some other VMM states that are
            intended to be lumped in here as well?

    .. describe:: teleporting(8)

            The machine is about to be teleported to a different host or process.

    Once a supported USB device is attached to the host, global USB
    filters (:py:func:`IHost.usb_device_filters` ) are activated. They can
    either ignore the device, or put it to USBDeviceState_Held state, or do

    If the device was ignored by global filters, or didn't match
    any filters at all (including guest ones), it is handled by the host
    in a normal way. In this case, the device state is determined by
    the host and can be one of USBDeviceState_Unavailable, USBDeviceState_Busy
    or USBDeviceState_Available, depending on the current device usage.
    
    Besides auto-capturing based on filters, the device can be manually
    captured by guests (:py:func:`IConsole.attach_usb_device` ) if its
    state is USBDeviceState_Busy, USBDeviceState_Available or
    USBDeviceState_Held.
    
    
    Due to differences in USB stack implementations in Linux and Win32,
    states USBDeviceState_Busy and USBDeviceState_Unavailable are applicable
    only to the Linux version of the product. This also means that (:py:func:`IConsole.attach_usb_device` ) can only succeed on Win32 if the
    device state is USBDeviceState_Held.

    The IVirtualBoxErrorInfo interface represents extended error information.
    
    Extended error information can be set by VirtualBox components after
    unsuccessful or partially successful method invocation. This information
    can be retrieved by the calling party as an IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object
    and then shown to the client in addition to the plain 32-bit result code.
    
    In MS COM, this interface extends the IErrorInfo interface,
    in XPCOM, it extends the nsIException interface. In both cases,
    it provides a set of common attributes to retrieve error
    information.
    
    Sometimes invocation of some component's method may involve methods of
    other components that may also fail (independently of this method's
    failure), or a series of non-fatal errors may precede a fatal error that
    causes method failure. In cases like that, it may be desirable to preserve
    information about all errors happened during method invocation and deliver
    it to the caller. The :py:func:`next_p`  attribute is intended
    specifically for this purpose and allows to represent a chain of errors
    through a single IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object set after method invocation.
    
    errors are stored to a chain in the reverse order, i.e. the
    initial error object you query right after method invocation is the last
    error set by the callee, the object it points to in the @a next attribute
    is the previous error and so on, up to the first error (which is the last
    in the chain).

        See :py:func:`IMachine.name`  and :py:func:`create_machine`  for more
        details about the machine name.
        
        @a groupName defines which additional subdirectory levels should be

        string which designates that the machine will not be related to a

    Represents a platform-independent appliance in OVF format. An instance of this is returned
    by :py:func:`IVirtualBox.create_appliance` , which can then be used to import and export
    virtual machines within an appliance with VirtualBox.
    
    The OVF standard suggests two different physical file formats:
    
    
    If the appliance is distributed as a set of files, there must be at least one XML descriptor
    file that conforms to the OVF standard and carries an .ovf file extension. If
    this descriptor file references other files such as disk images, as OVF appliances typically
    do, those additional files must be in the same directory as the descriptor file.
    
    If the appliance is distributed as a single file, it must be in TAR format and have the
    .ova file extension. This TAR file must then contain at least the OVF descriptor
    files and optionally other files.
    
    At this time, VirtualBox does not not yet support the packed (TAR) variant; support will
    be added with a later version.
    
    
    **Importing** an OVF appliance into VirtualBox as instances of
    :py:class:`IMachine`  involves the following sequence of API calls:
    
    
    Call :py:func:`IVirtualBox.create_appliance` . This will create an empty IAppliance object.
    
    
    On the new object, call :py:func:`read`  with the full path of the OVF file you
    would like to import. So long as this file is syntactically valid, this will succeed
    and fill the appliance object with the parsed data from the OVF file.
    
    
    Next, call :py:func:`interpret` , which analyzes the OVF data and sets up the
    contents of the IAppliance attributes accordingly. These can be inspected by a
    VirtualBox front-end such as the GUI, and the suggestions can be displayed to the
    user. In particular, the :py:func:`virtual_system_descriptions`  array contains
    instances of :py:class:`IVirtualSystemDescription`  which represent the virtual
    systems (machines) in the OVF, which in turn describe the virtual hardware prescribed
    by the OVF (network and hardware adapters, virtual disk images, memory size and so on).
    The GUI can then give the user the option to confirm and/or change these suggestions.
    
    
    If desired, call :py:func:`IVirtualSystemDescription.set_final_values`  for each
    virtual system (machine) to override the suggestions made by the :py:func:`interpret`  routine.
    
    
    Finally, call :py:func:`import_machines`  to create virtual machines in
    VirtualBox as instances of :py:class:`IMachine`  that match the information in the
    virtual system descriptions. After this call succeeded, the UUIDs of the machines created
    can be found in the :py:func:`machines`  array attribute.
    
    
    
    **Exporting** VirtualBox machines into an OVF appliance involves the following steps:
    
    
    As with importing, first call :py:func:`IVirtualBox.create_appliance`  to create
    an empty IAppliance object.
    
    
    For each machine you would like to export, call :py:func:`IMachine.export_to` 
    with the IAppliance object you just created. Each such call creates one instance of
    :py:class:`IVirtualSystemDescription`  inside the appliance.
    
    
    If desired, call :py:func:`IVirtualSystemDescription.set_final_values`  for each
    virtual system (machine) to override the suggestions made by the :py:func:`IMachine.export_to`  routine.
    
    
    Finally, call :py:func:`write`  with a path specification to have the OVF
    file written.

        The list below identifies the value sets that are possible depending on the
        :py:class:`VirtualSystemDescriptionType`  enum value in the array item in @a aTypes[]. In each case,
        the array item with the same index in @a OVFValues[] will contain the original value as contained
        in the OVF file (just for informational purposes), and the corresponding item in @a aVBoxValues[]
        will contain a suggested value to be used for VirtualBox. Depending on the description type,
        the @a aExtraConfigValues[] array item may also be used.
        
        
        
        "OS": the guest operating system type. There must be exactly one such array item on import. The
        corresponding item in @a aVBoxValues[] contains the suggested guest operating system for VirtualBox.
        This will be one of the values listed in :py:func:`IVirtualBox.guest_os_types` . The corresponding
        item in @a OVFValues[] will contain a numerical value that described the operating system in the OVF.
        
        
        "Name": the name to give to the new virtual machine. There can be at most one such array item;
        if none is present on import, then an automatic name will be created from the operating system
        type. The corresponding item im @a OVFValues[] will contain the suggested virtual machine name
        from the OVF file, and @a aVBoxValues[] will contain a suggestion for a unique VirtualBox
        :py:class:`IMachine`  name that does not exist yet.
        
        
        "Description": an arbitrary description.
        
        
        "License": the EULA section from the OVF, if present. It is the responsibility of the calling
        code to display such a license for agreement; the Main API does not enforce any such policy.
        
        
        Miscellaneous: reserved for future use.
        
        
        "CPU": the number of CPUs. There can be at most one such item, which will presently be ignored.
        
        
        "Memory": the amount of guest RAM, in bytes. There can be at most one such array item; if none
        is present on import, then VirtualBox will set a meaningful default based on the operating system
        type.
        
        
        "HardDiskControllerIDE": an IDE hard disk controller. There can be at most two such items.
        An optional value in @a OVFValues[] and @a aVBoxValues[] can be "PIIX3" or "PIIX4" to specify
        the type of IDE controller; this corresponds to the ResourceSubType element which VirtualBox
        writes into the OVF.
        The matching item in the @a aRefs[] array will contain an integer that items of the "Harddisk"
        type can use to specify which hard disk controller a virtual disk should be connected to.
        Note that in OVF, an IDE controller has two channels, corresponding to "master" and "slave"
        in traditional terminology, whereas the IDE storage controller that VirtualBox supports in
        its virtual machines supports four channels (primary master, primary slave, secondary master,
        secondary slave) and thus maps to two IDE controllers in the OVF sense.
        
        
        "HardDiskControllerSATA": an SATA hard disk controller. There can be at most one such item. This
        has no value in @a OVFValues[] or @a aVBoxValues[].
        The matching item in the @a aRefs[] array will be used as with IDE controllers (see above).
        
        
        "HardDiskControllerSCSI": a SCSI hard disk controller. There can be at most one such item.
        The items in @a OVFValues[] and @a aVBoxValues[] will either be "LsiLogic", "BusLogic" or
        "LsiLogicSas". (Note that in OVF, the LsiLogicSas controller is treated as a SCSI controller
        whereas VirtualBox considers it a class of storage controllers of its own; see
        :py:class:`StorageControllerType` ).
        The matching item in the @a aRefs[] array will be used as with IDE controllers (see above).
        
        
        "HardDiskImage": a virtual hard disk, most probably as a reference to an image file. There can be an
        arbitrary number of these items, one for each virtual disk image that accompanies the OVF.
        
        The array item in @a OVFValues[] will contain the file specification from the OVF file (without
        a path since the image file should be in the same location as the OVF file itself), whereas the
        item in @a aVBoxValues[] will contain a qualified path specification to where VirtualBox uses the
        hard disk image. This means that on import the image will be copied and converted from the
        "ovf" location to the "vbox" location; on export, this will be handled the other way round.
        
        The matching item in the @a aExtraConfigValues[] array must contain a string of the following
        format: "controller=<index>;channel=<c>"
        In this string, <index> must be an integer specifying the hard disk controller to connect
        the image to. That number must be the index of an array item with one of the hard disk controller
        types (HardDiskControllerSCSI, HardDiskControllerSATA, HardDiskControllerIDE).
        In addition, <c> must specify the channel to use on that controller. For IDE controllers,
        this can be 0 or 1 for master or slave, respectively. For compatibility with VirtualBox versions
        before 3.2, the values 2 and 3 (for secondary master and secondary slave) are also supported, but
        no longer exported. For SATA and SCSI controllers, the channel can range from 0-29.
        
        
        "CDROM": a virtual CD-ROM drive. The matching item in @a aExtraConfigValue[] contains the same
        attachment information as with "HardDiskImage" items.
        
        
        "CDROM": a virtual floppy drive. The matching item in @a aExtraConfigValue[] contains the same
        attachment information as with "HardDiskImage" items.
        
        
        "NetworkAdapter": a network adapter. The array item in @a aVBoxValues[] will specify the hardware
        for the network adapter, whereas the array item in @a aExtraConfigValues[] will have a string
        of the "type=<X>" format, where <X> must be either "NAT" or "Bridged".
        
        
        "USBController": a USB controller. There can be at most one such item. If, and only if, such an
        item is present, USB support will be enabled for the new virtual machine.
        
        
        "SoundCard": a sound card. There can be at most one such item. If and only if such an item is
        present, sound support will be enabled for the new virtual machine. Note that the virtual
        machine in VirtualBox will always be presented with the standard VirtualBox soundcard, which
        may be different from the virtual soundcard expected by the appliance.

    The IMachine interface represents a virtual machine, or guest, created
    in VirtualBox.
    
    This interface is used in two contexts. First of all, a collection of
    objects implementing this interface is stored in the
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.machines`  attribute which lists all the virtual
    machines that are currently registered with this VirtualBox
    installation. Also, once a session has been opened for the given virtual
    machine (e.g. the virtual machine is running), the machine object
    associated with the open session can be queried from the session object;
    see :py:class:`ISession`  for details.
    
    The main role of this interface is to expose the settings of the virtual
    machine and provide methods to change various aspects of the virtual
    machine's configuration. For machine objects stored in the
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.machines`  collection, all attributes are
    read-only unless explicitly stated otherwise in individual attribute
    and method descriptions.
    
    In order to change a machine setting, a session for this machine must be
    opened using one of the :py:func:`IMachine.lock_machine`  or
    :py:func:`IMachine.launch_vm_process`  methods. After the
    machine has been successfully locked for a session, a mutable machine object
    needs to be queried from the session object and then the desired settings
    changes can be applied to the returned object using IMachine attributes and
    methods. See the :py:class:`ISession`  interface description for more
    information about sessions.
    
    Note that IMachine does not provide methods to control virtual machine
    execution (such as start the machine, or power it down) -- these methods
    are grouped in a separate interface called :py:class:`IConsole` .

        """Locks the machine for the given session to enable the caller
        to make changes to the machine or start the VM or control
        VM execution.
        
        There are two ways to lock a machine for such uses:
        
        
        If you want to make changes to the machine settings,
        you must obtain an exclusive write lock on the machine
        by setting @a lockType to @c Write.
        
        This will only succeed if no other process has locked
        the machine to prevent conflicting changes. Only after
        an exclusive write lock has been obtained using this method, one
        can change all VM settings or execute the VM in the process
        space of the session object. (Note that the latter is only of
        interest if you actually want to write a new front-end for
        virtual machines; but this API gets called internally by
        the existing front-ends such as VBoxHeadless and the VirtualBox
        GUI to acquire a write lock on the machine that they are running.)
        
        On success, write-locking the machine for a session creates
        a second copy of the IMachine object. It is this second object
        upon which changes can be made; in VirtualBox terminology, the
        second copy is "mutable". It is only this second, mutable machine
        object upon which you can call methods that change the
        machine state. After having called this method, you can
        obtain this second, mutable machine object using the
        :py:func:`ISession.machine`  attribute.
        
        If you only want to check the machine state or control
        machine execution without actually changing machine
        settings (e.g. to get access to VM statistics or take
        a snapshot or save the machine state), then set the
        @a lockType argument to @c Shared.
        
        If no other session has obtained a lock, you will obtain an
        exclusive write lock as described above. However, if another
        session has already obtained such a lock, then a link to that
        existing session will be established which allows you
        to control that existing session.
        
        To find out which type of lock was obtained, you can
        inspect :py:func:`ISession.type_p` , which will have been
        set to either @c WriteLock or @c Shared.
        
        
        
        In either case, you can get access to the :py:class:`IConsole` 
        object which controls VM execution.
        
        Also in all of the above cases, one must always call
        :py:func:`ISession.unlock_machine`  to release the lock on the machine, or
        the machine's state will eventually be set to "Aborted".
        
        To change settings on a machine, the following sequence is typically
        performed:

        """Spawns a new process that will execute the virtual machine and obtains a shared
        lock on the machine for the calling session.
        
        If launching the VM succeeds, the new VM process will create its own session
        and write-lock the machine for it, preventing conflicting changes from other
        processes. If the machine is already locked (because it is already running or
        because another session has a write lock), launching the VM process will therefore
        fail. Reversely, future attempts to obtain a write lock will also fail while the
        machine is running.
        
        The caller's session object remains separate from the session opened by the new
        VM process. It receives its own :py:class:`IConsole`  object which can be used
        to control machine execution, but it cannot be used to change all VM settings
        which would be available after a :py:func:`lock_machine`  call.
        
        The caller must eventually release the session's shared lock by calling
        :py:func:`ISession.unlock_machine`  on the local session object once this call
        has returned. However, the session's state (see :py:func:`ISession.state` )
        will not return to "Unlocked" until the remote session has also unlocked
        the machine (i.e. the machine has stopped running).
        
        Launching a VM process can take some time (a new VM is started in a new process,
        for which memory and other resources need to be set up). Because of this,
        an :py:class:`IProgress`  object is returned to allow the caller to wait
        for this asynchronous operation to be completed. Until then, the caller's
        session object remains in the "Unlocked" state, and its :py:func:`ISession.machine` 
        and :py:func:`ISession.console`  attributes cannot be accessed.
        It is recommended to use :py:func:`IProgress.wait_for_completion`  or
        similar calls to wait for completion. Completion is signalled when the VM
        is powered on. If launching the VM fails, error messages can be queried
        via the progress object, if available.
        
        The progress object will have at least 2 sub-operations. The first
        operation covers the period up to the new VM process calls powerUp.
        The subsequent operations mirror the :py:func:`IConsole.power_up` 
        progress object. Because :py:func:`IConsole.power_up`  may require
        some extra sub-operations, the :py:func:`IProgress.operation_count` 
        may change at the completion of operation.
        
        For details on the teleportation progress operation, see
        :py:func:`IConsole.power_up` .

        are applied onto the server environment putenv style, i.e. "VAR=VALUE" for setting/replacing
        and "VAR" for unsetting. -->
        The @a environment argument is a string containing definitions of
        environment variables in the following format:
        
        ::

             NAME[=VALUE]\n
             NAME[=VALUE]\n
             ...


        where \\n is the new line character. These environment
        variables will be appended to the environment of the VirtualBox server
        process. If an environment variable exists both in the server process
        and in this list, the value from this list takes precedence over the
        server's variable. If the value of the environment variable is
        omitted, this variable will be removed from the resulting environment.

        is inherited by the started process as is.

            @a session parameter may be @c null (if it is non-null it isn't
            used in any way), and the @a progress return value will be always
            @c null. The operation completes immediately.
            "": use the per-VM default frontend if set, otherwise
            the global default defined in the system properties. If neither
            are set, the API will launch a "gui" session, which may

        cleanup before the machine is unregistered.
        
        This method does not delete any files. It only changes the machine configuration and
        the list of registered machines in the VirtualBox object. To delete the files which
        belonged to the machine, including the XML file of the machine itself, call
        :py:func:`delete_config` , optionally with the array of IMedium objects which was returned
        from this method.
        
        How thoroughly this method cleans up the machine configuration before unregistering
        the machine depends on the @a cleanupMode argument.
        
        
        With "UnregisterOnly", the machine will only be unregistered, but no additional
        cleanup will be performed. The call will fail if the machine is in "Saved" state
        or has any snapshots or any media attached (see :py:class:`IMediumAttachment` ).
        It is the responsibility of the caller to delete all such configuration in this mode.
        In this mode, the API behaves like the former @c IVirtualBox::unregisterMachine() API
        which it replaces.
        With "DetachAllReturnNone", the call will succeed even if the machine is in "Saved"
        state or if it has snapshots or media attached. All media attached to the current machine
        state or in snapshots will be detached. No medium objects will be returned;
        all of the machine's media will remain open.
        With "DetachAllReturnHardDisksOnly", the call will behave like with "DetachAllReturnNone",
        except that all the hard disk medium objects which were detached from the machine will
        be returned as an array. This allows for quickly passing them to the :py:func:`delete_config` 
        API for closing and deletion.
        With "Full", the call will behave like with "DetachAllReturnHardDisksOnly", except
        that all media will be returned in the array, including removable media like DVDs and
        floppies. This might be useful if the user wants to inspect in detail which media were
        attached to the machine. Be careful when passing the media array to :py:func:`delete_config` 
        in that case because users will typically want to preserve ISO and RAW image files.
        
        
        A typical implementation will use "DetachAllReturnHardDisksOnly" and then pass the
        resulting IMedium array to :py:func:`delete_config` . This way, the machine is completely
        deleted with all its saved states and hard disk images, but images for removable
        drives (such as ISO and RAW files) will remain on disk.
        
        This API does not verify whether the media files returned in the array are still
        attached to other machines (i.e. shared between several machines). If such a shared
        image is passed to :py:func:`delete_config`  however, closing the image will fail there
        and the image will be silently skipped.
        
        This API may, however, move media from this machine's media registry to other media
        registries (see :py:class:`IMedium`  for details on media registries). For machines
        created with VirtualBox 4.0 or later, if media from this machine's media registry
        are also attached to another machine (shared attachments), each such medium will be
        moved to another machine's registry. This is because without this machine's media
        registry, the other machine cannot find its media any more and would become inaccessible.
        
        This API implicitly calls :py:func:`save_settings`  to save all current machine settings
        before unregistering it. It may also silently call :py:func:`save_settings`  on other machines
        if media are moved to other machines' media registries.
        
        After successful method invocation, the :py:class:`IMachineRegisteredEvent`  event
        is fired.
        
        The call will fail if the machine is currently locked (see :py:class:`ISession` ).
        
        
        If the given machine is inaccessible (see :py:func:`accessible` ), it
        will be unregistered and fully uninitialized right afterwards. As a result,
        the returned machine object will be unusable and an attempt to call
        **any** method will return the "Object not ready" error.

        the same as the one returned from a previous :py:func:`unregister`  call.
        
        This method must only be called on machines which are either write-locked (i.e. on instances
        returned by :py:func:`ISession.machine` ) or on unregistered machines (i.e. not yet
        registered machines created by :py:func:`IVirtualBox.create_machine`  or opened by

        argument other than "UnregisterOnly", this will delete all saved state files that
        the machine had in use; possibly one if the machine was in "Saved" state and one
        for each online snapshot that the machine had.
        On each medium object passed in the @a aMedia array, this will call
        :py:func:`IMedium.close` . If that succeeds, this will attempt to delete the
        medium's storage on disk. Since the :py:func:`IMedium.close`  call will fail if the medium is still
        in use, e.g. because it is still attached to a second machine; in that case the
        storage will not be deleted.
        Finally, the machine's own XML file will be deleted.
        
        
        Since deleting large disk image files can be a time-consuming I/O operation, this
        method operates asynchronously and returns an IProgress object to allow the caller
        to monitor the progress. There will be one sub-operation for each file that is

        media to keep the medium chain valid (in other words, all changes
        represented by media being deleted will be propagated to their child
        medium). After that, this snapshot's differencing medium will be
        deleted. The parent of this snapshot will become a new parent for all
        its child snapshots.
        
        If the deleted snapshot is the current one, its parent snapshot will
        become a new current snapshot. The current machine state is not directly
        affected in this case, except that currently attached differencing
        media based on media of the deleted snapshot will be also merged as
        described above.
        
        If the deleted snapshot is the first or current snapshot, then the
        respective IMachine attributes will be adjusted. Deleting the current
        snapshot will also implicitly call :py:func:`save_settings` 
        to make all current machine settings permanent.
        
        Deleting a snapshot has the following preconditions:
        
        
        Child media of all normal media of the deleted snapshot
        must be accessible (see :py:func:`IMedium.state` ) for this
        operation to succeed. If only one running VM refers to all images
        which participates in merging the operation can be performed while
        the VM is running. Otherwise all virtual machines whose media are
        directly or indirectly based on the media of deleted snapshot must
        be powered off. In any case, online snapshot deleting usually is
        slower than the same operation without any running VM.
        
        You cannot delete the snapshot if a medium attached to it has
        more than one child medium (differencing images) because otherwise
        merging would be impossible. This might be the case if there is
        more than one child snapshot or differencing images were created
        for other reason (e.g. implicitly because of multiple machine
        attachments).
        
        
        The virtual machine's :py:func:`state` state is
        changed to "DeletingSnapshot", "DeletingSnapshotOnline" or
        "DeletingSnapshotPaused" while this operation is in progress.
        
        
        Merging medium contents can be very time and disk space
        consuming, if these media are big in size and have many
        children. However, if the snapshot being deleted is the last
        (head) snapshot on the branch, the operation will be rather

    A guest session represents one impersonated user account in the guest, so
    every operation will use the same credentials specified when creating
    the session object via :py:func:`IGuest.create_session` .
    
    There can be a maximum of 32 sessions at once per VM, whereas session 0
    is reserved for the root session.
    <!-- r=bird: Is the root session part of the maximum of 32?? Not really clear. -->
    This root session is controlling all other guest sessions and also is
    responsible for actions which require system level privileges.
    
    Each guest session keeps track of the guest directories and files that
    it opened as well as guest processes it has created.  To work on guest
    files or directories a guest session offers methods to open or create
    such objects (see :py:func:`IGuestSession.file_open`  or
    :py:func:`IGuestSession.directory_open`  for instance).  Similarly,
    there a methods for creating guest processes.
    
    There can be up to 2048 objects (guest processes, files and directories)
    a time per guest session.  Exceeding the limit will result in an error.
    <!-- @todo r=bird: Add specific VBOX_E_XXX error for this and document it here! -->
    
    When done with either of these objects, including the guest session itself,
    use the appropriate close() method to let the object do its cleanup work.
    
    Closing a session via :py:func:`IGuestSession.close`  will try to close
    all the mentioned objects above unless these objects are still used by
    a client.
    
    A set of environment variables changes is associated with each session
    (:py:func:`IGuestSession.environment_changes` ).  These are applied to
    the base environment of the impersonated guest user when creating a new
    guest process.  For additional flexibility the :py:func:`IGuestSession.process_create` 
    and :py:func:`IGuestSession.process_create_ex`  methods allows you to
    specify individual environment changes for each process you create.
    With newer guest addition versions, the base environment is also made
    available via :py:func:`IGuestSession.environment_base` .  (One reason
    for why we record changes to a base environment instead of working
    directly on an environment block is that we need to be compatible
    with older guest additions.  Another reason is that this way it is always
    possible to undo all the changes you've scheduled.)

            guest user (:py:func:`IGuestSession.environment_base` ) when

            detailed description of available flags.

            Timeout (in ms) for limiting the guest process' running time.
            Pass 0 for an infinite timeout. On timeout the guest process will be
            killed and its status will be put to an appropriate value. See
            :py:class:`ProcessStatus`  for more information.

        in priority of type :class:`ProcessPriority`
            Process priority to use for execution, see :py:class:`ProcessPriority` 
            for available priority levels.
            This is silently ignored if not supported by guest additions.

        in affinity of type int
            Processor affinity to set for the new process.  This is a list of
            guest CPU numbers the process is allowed to run on.
            
            This is silently ignored if the guest does not support setting the

            this feature.

    The IProgress interface is used to track and control
    asynchronous tasks within VirtualBox.
    
    An instance of this is returned every time VirtualBox starts
    an asynchronous task (in other words, a separate thread) which
    continues to run after a method call returns. For example,
    :py:func:`IMachine.save_state` , which saves the state of
    a running virtual machine, can take a long time to complete.
    To be able to display a progress bar, a user interface such as
    the VirtualBox graphical user interface can use the IProgress
    object returned by that method.
    
    Note that IProgress is a "read-only" interface in the sense
    that only the VirtualBox internals behind the Main API can
    create and manipulate progress objects, whereas client code
    can only use the IProgress object to monitor a task's
    progress and, if :py:func:`cancelable`  is @c true,
    cancel the task by calling :py:func:`cancel` .
    
    A task represented by IProgress consists of either one or
    several sub-operations that run sequentially, one by one (see
    :py:func:`operation`  and :py:func:`operation_count` ).
    Every operation is identified by a number (starting from 0)

class ISnapshot(Interface):
    """
    The ISnapshot interface represents a snapshot of the virtual
    machine.
    
    Together with the differencing media that are created
    when a snapshot is taken, a machine can be brought back to
    the exact state it was in when the snapshot was taken.
    
    The ISnapshot interface has no methods, only attributes; snapshots
    are controlled through methods of the :py:class:`IMachine`  interface
    which also manage the media associated with the snapshot.
    The following operations exist:
    
    
    :py:func:`IMachine.take_snapshot`  creates a new snapshot
    by creating new, empty differencing images for the machine's
    media and saving the VM settings and (if the VM is running)
    the current VM state in the snapshot.
    
    The differencing images will then receive all data written to
    the machine's media, while their parent (base) images
    remain unmodified after the snapshot has been taken (see
    :py:class:`IMedium`  for details about differencing images).
    This simplifies restoring a machine to the state of a snapshot:
    only the differencing images need to be deleted.
    
    The current machine state is not changed by taking a snapshot
    except that :py:func:`IMachine.current_snapshot`  is set to
    the newly created snapshot, which is also added to the machine's
    snapshots tree.
    
    
    :py:func:`IMachine.restore_snapshot`  resets a machine to
    the state of a previous snapshot by deleting the differencing
    image of each of the machine's media and setting the machine's
    settings and state to the state that was saved in the snapshot (if any).
    
    This destroys the machine's current state. After calling this,
    :py:func:`IMachine.current_snapshot`  points to the snapshot
    that was restored.
    
    
    :py:func:`IMachine.delete_snapshot`  deletes a snapshot
    without affecting the current machine state.
    
    This does not change the current machine state, but instead frees the
    resources allocated when the snapshot was taken: the settings and machine
    state file are deleted (if any), and the snapshot's differencing image for
    each of the machine's media gets merged with its parent image.
    
    Neither the current machine state nor other snapshots are affected
    by this operation, except that parent media will be modified
    to contain the disk data associated with the snapshot being deleted.
    
    When deleting the current snapshot, the :py:func:`IMachine.current_snapshot` 
    attribute is set to the current snapshot's parent or @c null if it
    has no parent. Otherwise the attribute is unchanged.
    
    
    
    Each snapshot contains a copy of virtual machine's settings (hardware
    configuration etc.). This copy is contained in an immutable (read-only)
    instance of :py:class:`IMachine`  which is available from the snapshot's
    :py:func:`machine`  attribute. When restoring the snapshot, these
    settings are copied back to the original machine.
    
    In addition, if the machine was running when the
    snapshot was taken (:py:func:`IMachine.state`  is :py:attr:`MachineState.running` ),
    the current VM state is saved in the snapshot (similarly to what happens
    when a VM's state is saved). The snapshot is then said to be *online*
    because when restoring it, the VM will be running.
    
    If the machine was in :py:attr:`MachineState.saved` saved saved,
    the snapshot receives a copy of the execution state file
    (:py:func:`IMachine.state_file_path` ).
    
    Otherwise, if the machine was not running (:py:attr:`MachineState.powered_off` 
    or :py:attr:`MachineState.aborted` ), the snapshot is *offline*;
    it then contains a so-called "zero execution state", representing a
    machine that is powered off.

    """
    The IMediumAttachment interface links storage media to virtual machines.
    For each medium (:py:class:`IMedium` ) which has been attached to a
    storage controller (:py:class:`IStorageController` ) of a machine
    (:py:class:`IMachine` ) via the :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` 
    method, one instance of IMediumAttachment is added to the machine's
    :py:func:`IMachine.medium_attachments`  array attribute.
    
    Each medium attachment specifies the storage controller as well as a
    port and device number and the IMedium instance representing a virtual
    hard disk or floppy or DVD image.
    
    For removable media (DVDs or floppies), there are two additional
    options. For one, the IMedium instance can be @c null to represent
    an empty drive with no media inserted (see :py:func:`IMachine.mount_medium` );
    secondly, the medium can be one of the pseudo-media for host drives
    listed in :py:func:`IHost.dvd_drives`  or :py:func:`IHost.floppy_drives` .
    
    Attaching Hard Disks
    
    Hard disks are attached to virtual machines using the
    :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device`  method and detached using the
    :py:func:`IMachine.detach_device`  method. Depending on a medium's
    type (see :py:func:`IMedium.type_p` ), hard disks are attached either
    *directly* or *indirectly*.
    
    When a hard disk is being attached directly, it is associated with the
    virtual machine and used for hard disk operations when the machine is
    running. When a hard disk is being attached indirectly, a new differencing
    hard disk linked to it is implicitly created and this differencing hard
    disk is associated with the machine and used for hard disk operations.
    This also means that if :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device`  performs
    a direct attachment then the same hard disk will be returned in response
    to the subsequent :py:func:`IMachine.get_medium`  call; however if
    an indirect attachment is performed then
    :py:func:`IMachine.get_medium`  will return the implicitly created
    differencing hard disk, not the original one passed to :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` . In detail:
    
    
    **Normal base** hard disks that do not have children (i.e.
    differencing hard disks linked to them) and that are not already
    attached to virtual machines in snapshots are attached **directly**.
    Otherwise, they are attached **indirectly** because having
    dependent children or being part of the snapshot makes it impossible
    to modify hard disk contents without breaking the integrity of the
    dependent party. The :py:func:`IMedium.read_only`  attribute allows to
    quickly determine the kind of the attachment for the given hard
    disk. Note that if a normal base hard disk is to be indirectly
    attached to a virtual machine with snapshots then a special
    procedure called *smart attachment* is performed (see below).
    **Normal differencing** hard disks are like normal base hard disks:
    they are attached **directly** if they do not have children and are
    not attached to virtual machines in snapshots, and **indirectly**
    otherwise. Note that the smart attachment procedure is never performed
    for differencing hard disks.
    **Immutable** hard disks are always attached **indirectly** because
    they are designed to be non-writable. If an immutable hard disk is
    attached to a virtual machine with snapshots then a special
    procedure called smart attachment is performed (see below).
    **Writethrough** hard disks are always attached **directly**,
    also as designed. This also means that writethrough hard disks cannot
    have other hard disks linked to them at all.
    **Shareable** hard disks are always attached **directly**,
    also as designed. This also means that shareable hard disks cannot
    have other hard disks linked to them at all. They behave almost
    like writethrough hard disks, except that shareable hard disks can
    be attached to several virtual machines which are running, allowing
    concurrent accesses. You need special cluster software running in
    the virtual machines to make use of such disks.
    
    
    Note that the same hard disk, regardless of its type, may be attached to
    more than one virtual machine at a time. In this case, the machine that is
    started first gains exclusive access to the hard disk and attempts to
    start other machines having this hard disk attached will fail until the
    first machine is powered down.
    
    Detaching hard disks is performed in a *deferred* fashion. This means
    that the given hard disk remains associated with the given machine after a
    successful :py:func:`IMachine.detach_device`  call until
    :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings`  is called to save all changes to
    machine settings to disk. This deferring is necessary to guarantee that
    the hard disk configuration may be restored at any time by a call to
    :py:func:`IMachine.discard_settings`  before the settings
    are saved (committed).
    
    Note that if :py:func:`IMachine.discard_settings`  is called after
    indirectly attaching some hard disks to the machine but before a call to
    :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings`  is made, it will implicitly delete
    all differencing hard disks implicitly created by
    :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device`  for these indirect attachments.
    Such implicitly created hard disks will also be immediately deleted when
    detached explicitly using the :py:func:`IMachine.detach_device` 
    call if it is made before :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings` . This
    implicit deletion is safe because newly created differencing hard
    disks do not contain any user data.
    
    However, keep in mind that detaching differencing hard disks that were
    implicitly created by :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` 
    before the last :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings`  call will
    **not** implicitly delete them as they may already contain some data
    (for example, as a result of virtual machine execution). If these hard
    disks are no more necessary, the caller can always delete them explicitly
    using :py:func:`IMedium.delete_storage`  after they are actually de-associated
    from this machine by the :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings`  call.
    
    Smart Attachment
    
    When normal base or immutable hard disks are indirectly attached to a
    virtual machine then some additional steps are performed to make sure the
    virtual machine will have the most recent "view" of the hard disk being
    attached. These steps include walking through the machine's snapshots
    starting from the current one and going through ancestors up to the first
    snapshot. Hard disks attached to the virtual machine in all
    of the encountered snapshots are checked whether they are descendants of
    the given normal base or immutable hard disk. The first found child (which
    is the differencing hard disk) will be used instead of the normal base or
    immutable hard disk as a parent for creating a new differencing hard disk
    that will be actually attached to the machine. And only if no descendants
    are found or if the virtual machine does not have any snapshots then the
    normal base or immutable hard disk will be used itself as a parent for
    this differencing hard disk.
    
    It is easier to explain what smart attachment does using the
    following example:
    
    ::

         BEFORE attaching B.vdi:       AFTER attaching B.vdi:
         
         Snapshot 1 (B.vdi)            Snapshot 1 (B.vdi)
         Snapshot 2 (D1->B.vdi)        Snapshot 2 (D1->B.vdi)
         Snapshot 3 (D2->D1.vdi)       Snapshot 3 (D2->D1.vdi)
         Snapshot 4 (none)             Snapshot 4 (none)
         CurState   (none)             CurState   (D3->D2.vdi)
         
         NOT
         ...
         CurState   (D3->B.vdi)


    The first column is the virtual machine configuration before the base hard
    disk B.vdi is attached, the second column shows the machine after
    this hard disk is attached. Constructs like D1->B.vdi and similar
    mean that the hard disk that is actually attached to the machine is a
    differencing hard disk, D1.vdi, which is linked to (based on)
    another hard disk, B.vdi.
    
    As we can see from the example, the hard disk B.vdi was detached
    from the machine before taking Snapshot 4. Later, after Snapshot 4 was
    taken, the user decides to attach B.vdi again. B.vdi has
    dependent child hard disks (D1.vdi, D2.vdi), therefore
    it cannot be attached directly and needs an indirect attachment (i.e.
    implicit creation of a new differencing hard disk). Due to the smart
    attachment procedure, the new differencing hard disk
    (D3.vdi) will be based on D2.vdi, not on
    B.vdi itself, since D2.vdi is the most recent view of
    B.vdi existing for this snapshot branch of the given virtual
    machine.
    
    Note that if there is more than one descendant hard disk of the given base
    hard disk found in a snapshot, and there is an exact device, channel and
    bus match, then this exact match will be used. Otherwise, the youngest
    descendant will be picked up.
    
    There is one more important aspect of the smart attachment procedure which
    is not related to snapshots at all. Before walking through the snapshots
    as described above, the backup copy of the current list of hard disk
    attachment is searched for descendants. This backup copy is created when
    the hard disk configuration is changed for the first time after the last
    :py:func:`IMachine.save_settings`  call and used by
    :py:func:`IMachine.discard_settings`  to undo the recent hard disk
    changes. When such a descendant is found in this backup copy, it will be
    simply re-attached back, without creating a new differencing hard disk for
    it. This optimization is necessary to make it possible to re-attach the
    base or immutable hard disk to a different bus, channel or device slot
    without losing the contents of the differencing hard disk actually
    attached to the machine in place of it.

class IMedium(Interface):
    """
    The IMedium interface represents virtual storage for a machine's
    hard disks, CD/DVD or floppy drives. It will typically represent
    a disk image on the host, for example a VDI or VMDK file representing
    a virtual hard disk, or an ISO or RAW file representing virtual
    removable media, but can also point to a network location (e.g.
    for iSCSI targets).
    
    Instances of IMedium are connected to virtual machines by way of medium
    attachments, which link the storage medium to a particular device slot
    of a storage controller of the virtual machine.
    In the VirtualBox API, virtual storage is therefore always represented
    by the following chain of object links:
    
    
    :py:func:`IMachine.storage_controllers`  contains an array of
    storage controllers (IDE, SATA, SCSI, SAS or a floppy controller;
    these are instances of :py:class:`IStorageController` ).
    :py:func:`IMachine.medium_attachments`  contains an array of
    medium attachments (instances of :py:class:`IMediumAttachment` 
    created by :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` ),
    each containing a storage controller from the above array, a
    port/device specification, and an instance of IMedium representing
    the medium storage (image file).
    
    For removable media, the storage medium is optional; a medium
    attachment with no medium represents a CD/DVD or floppy drive
    with no medium inserted. By contrast, hard disk attachments
    will always have an IMedium object attached.
    Each IMedium in turn points to a storage unit (such as a file
    on the host computer or a network resource) that holds actual
    data. This location is represented by the :py:func:`location` 
    attribute.
    
    
    Existing media are opened using :py:func:`IVirtualBox.open_medium` ;
    new hard disk media can be created with the VirtualBox API using the
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.create_medium`  method. Differencing hard
    disks (see below) are usually implicitly created by VirtualBox as
    needed, but may also be created explicitly using :py:func:`create_diff_storage` .
    VirtualBox cannot create CD/DVD or floppy images (ISO and RAW files); these
    should be created with external tools and then opened from within VirtualBox.
    
    Only for CD/DVDs and floppies, an IMedium instance can also represent a host
    drive. In that case the :py:func:`id_p`  attribute contains the UUID of
    one of the drives in :py:func:`IHost.dvd_drives`  or :py:func:`IHost.floppy_drives` .
    
    Media registries
    
    When a medium has been opened or created using one of the aforementioned
    APIs, it becomes "known" to VirtualBox. Known media can be attached
    to virtual machines and re-found through :py:func:`IVirtualBox.open_medium` .
    They also appear in the global
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.hard_disks` ,
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.dvd_images`  and
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.floppy_images`  arrays.
    
    Prior to VirtualBox 4.0, opening a medium added it to a global media registry
    in the VirtualBox.xml file, which was shared between all machines and made
    transporting machines and their media from one host to another difficult.
    
    Starting with VirtualBox 4.0, media are only added to a registry when they are
    *attached* to a machine using :py:func:`IMachine.attach_device` . For
    backwards compatibility, which registry a medium is added to depends on which
    VirtualBox version created a machine:
    
    
    If the medium has first been attached to a machine which was created by
    VirtualBox 4.0 or later, it is added to that machine's media registry in
    the machine XML settings file. This way all information about a machine's
    media attachments is contained in a single file and can be transported
    easily.
    For older media attachments (i.e. if the medium was first attached to a
    machine which was created with a VirtualBox version before 4.0), media
    continue to be registered in the global VirtualBox settings file, for
    backwards compatibility.
    
    
    See :py:func:`IVirtualBox.open_medium`  for more information.
    
    Media are removed from media registries by the :py:func:`IMedium.close` ,
    :py:func:`delete_storage`  and :py:func:`merge_to`  methods.
    
    Accessibility checks
    
    VirtualBox defers media accessibility checks until the :py:func:`refresh_state` 
    method is called explicitly on a medium. This is done to make the VirtualBox object
    ready for serving requests as fast as possible and let the end-user
    application decide if it needs to check media accessibility right away or not.
    
    As a result, when VirtualBox starts up (e.g. the VirtualBox
    object gets created for the first time), all known media are in the
    "Inaccessible" state, but the value of the :py:func:`last_access_error` 
    attribute is an empty string because no actual accessibility check has
    been made yet.
    
    After calling :py:func:`refresh_state` , a medium is considered
    *accessible* if its storage unit can be read. In that case, the
    :py:func:`state`  attribute has a value of "Created". If the storage
    unit cannot be read (for example, because it is located on a disconnected
    network resource, or was accidentally deleted outside VirtualBox),
    the medium is considered *inaccessible*, which is indicated by the
    "Inaccessible" state. The exact reason why the medium is inaccessible can be
    obtained by reading the :py:func:`last_access_error`  attribute.
    
    Medium types
    
    There are five types of medium behavior which are stored in the
    :py:func:`type_p`  attribute (see :py:class:`MediumType` ) and
    which define the medium's behavior with attachments and snapshots.
    
    All media can be also divided in two groups: *base* media and
    *differencing* media. A base medium contains all sectors of the
    medium data in its own storage and therefore can be used independently.
    In contrast, a differencing medium is a "delta" to some other medium and
    contains only those sectors which differ from that other medium, which is
    then called a *parent*. The differencing medium is said to be
    *linked to* that parent. The parent may be itself a differencing
    medium, thus forming a chain of linked media. The last element in that
    chain must always be a base medium. Note that several differencing
    media may be linked to the same parent medium.
    
    Differencing media can be distinguished from base media by querying the
    :py:func:`parent`  attribute: base media do not have parents they would
    depend on, so the value of this attribute is always @c null for them.
    Using this attribute, it is possible to walk up the medium tree (from the
    child medium to its parent). It is also possible to walk down the tree
    using the :py:func:`children`  attribute.
    
    Note that the type of all differencing media is "normal"; all other
    values are meaningless for them. Base media may be of any type.
    
    Automatic composition of the file name part
    
    Another extension to the :py:func:`IMedium.location`  attribute is that
    there is a possibility to cause VirtualBox to compose a unique value for
    the file name part of the location using the UUID of the hard disk. This
    applies only to hard disks in :py:attr:`MediumState.not_created`  state,
    e.g. before the storage unit is created, and works as follows. You set the
    value of the :py:func:`IMedium.location`  attribute to a location
    specification which only contains the path specification but not the file
    name part and ends with either a forward slash or a backslash character.
    In response, VirtualBox will generate a new UUID for the hard disk and
    compose the file name using the following pattern:
    
    ::

         <path>/{<uuid>}.<ext>


    where <path> is the supplied path specification,
    <uuid> is the newly generated UUID and <ext>
    is the default extension for the storage format of this hard disk. After
    that, you may call any of the methods that create a new hard disk storage
    unit and they will use the generated UUID and file name.

        When the medium is locked for reading, it cannot be modified
        from within VirtualBox. This means that any method that changes
        the properties of this medium or contents of the storage unit
        will return an error (unless explicitly stated otherwise). That
        includes an attempt to start a virtual machine that wants to
        write to the medium.
        
        When the virtual machine is started up, it locks for reading all
        media it uses in read-only mode. If some medium cannot be locked
        for reading, the startup procedure will fail.
        A medium is typically locked for reading while it is used by a running
        virtual machine but has a depending differencing image that receives
        the actual write operations. This way one base medium can have
        multiple child differencing images which can be written to
        simultaneously. Read-only media such as DVD and floppy images are
        also locked for reading only (so they can be in use by multiple
        machines simultaneously).
        
        A medium is also locked for reading when it is the source of a
        write operation such as :py:func:`clone_to`  or :py:func:`merge_to` .
        
        The medium locked for reading must be unlocked by abandoning the
        returned token object, see :py:class:`IToken` . Calls to
        :py:func:`lock_read`  can be nested and the lock is actually released
        when all callers have abandoned the token.
        
        This method sets the medium state (see :py:func:`state` ) to

        this operation to succeed is :py:attr:`MediumState.created` .
        
        Before the operation starts, the medium is placed in
        :py:attr:`MediumState.deleting`  state and gets removed from the list
        of remembered hard disks (media registry). If the delete operation
        fails, the medium will be remembered again and placed back to
        :py:attr:`MediumState.created`  state.
        
        After the returned progress object reports that the operation is
        complete, the medium state will be set to

    def merge_to(self, target):
        """Starts merging the contents of this medium and all intermediate
        differencing media in the chain to the given target medium.
        
        The target medium must be either a descendant of this medium or
        its ancestor (otherwise this method will immediately return a failure).
        It follows that there are two logical directions of the merge operation:
        from ancestor to descendant (*forward merge*) and from descendant to
        ancestor (*backward merge*). Let us consider the following medium
        chain:
        
        Base <- Diff_1 <- Diff_2
        
        Here, calling this method on the Base medium object with
        Diff_2 as an argument will be a forward merge; calling it on
        Diff_2 with Base as an argument will be a backward
        merge. Note that in both cases the contents of the resulting medium
        will be the same, the only difference is the medium object that takes
        the result of the merge operation. In case of the forward merge in the
        above example, the result will be written to Diff_2; in case of
        the backward merge, the result will be written to Base. In
        other words, the result of the operation is always stored in the target
        medium.
        
        Upon successful operation completion, the storage units of all media in
        the chain between this (source) medium and the target medium, including
        the source medium itself, will be automatically deleted and the
        relevant medium objects (including this medium) will become
        uninitialized. This means that any attempt to call any of
        their methods or attributes will fail with the
        "Object not ready" (E_ACCESSDENIED) error. Applied to the above
        example, the forward merge of Base to Diff_2 will
        delete and uninitialize both Base and Diff_1 media.
        Note that Diff_2 in this case will become a base medium
        itself since it will no longer be based on any other medium.
        
        Considering the above, all of the following conditions must be met in
        order for the merge operation to succeed:
        
        
        Neither this (source) medium nor any intermediate
        differencing medium in the chain between it and the target
        medium is attached to any virtual machine.
        
        
        Neither the source medium nor the target medium is an
        :py:attr:`MediumType.immutable`  medium.
        
        
        The part of the medium tree from the source medium to the
        target medium is a linear chain, i.e. all medium in this
        chain have exactly one child which is the next medium in this
        chain. The only exception from this rule is the target medium in
        the forward merge operation; it is allowed to have any number of
        child media because the merge operation will not change its
        logical contents (as it is seen by the guest OS or by children).
        
        
        None of the involved media are in
        :py:attr:`MediumState.locked_read`  or
        :py:attr:`MediumState.locked_write`  state.

class IUSBDeviceFilter(Interface):
    """
    The IUSBDeviceFilter interface represents an USB device filter used
    to perform actions on a group of USB devices.
    
    This type of filters is used by running virtual machines to
    automatically capture selected USB devices once they are physically
    attached to the host computer.
    
    A USB device is matched to the given device filter if and only if all
    attributes of the device match the corresponding attributes of the
    filter (that is, attributes are joined together using the logical AND
    operation). On the other hand, all together, filters in the list of
    filters carry the semantics of the logical OR operation. So if it is
    desirable to create a match like "this vendor id OR this product id",
    one needs to create two filters and specify "any match" (see below)
    for unused attributes.
    
    All filter attributes used for matching are strings. Each string
    is an expression representing a set of values of the corresponding
    device attribute, that will match the given filter. Currently, the
    following filtering expressions are supported:
    
    
    *Interval filters*. Used to specify valid intervals for
    integer device attributes (Vendor ID, Product ID and Revision).
    The format of the string is:
    
    int:((m)|([m]-[n]))(,(m)|([m]-[n]))*
    
    where m and n are integer numbers, either in octal
    (starting from 0), hexadecimal (starting from 0x)
    or decimal (otherwise) form, so that m < n. If m
    is omitted before a dash (-), the minimum possible integer
    is assumed; if n is omitted after a dash, the maximum
    possible integer is assumed.
    
    *Boolean filters*. Used to specify acceptable values for
    boolean device attributes. The format of the string is:
    
    true|false|yes|no|0|1
    
    
    *Exact match*. Used to specify a single value for the given
    device attribute. Any string that doesn't start with int:
    represents the exact match. String device attributes are compared to
    this string including case of symbols. Integer attributes are first
    converted to a string (see individual filter attributes) and then
    compared ignoring case.
    
    
    *Any match*. Any value of the corresponding device attribute
    will match the given filter. An empty or @c null string is
    used to construct this type of filtering expressions.
    
    
    
    
    
    On the Windows host platform, interval filters are not currently
    available. Also all string filter attributes
    (:py:func:`manufacturer` , :py:func:`product` ,
    :py:func:`serial_number` ) are ignored, so they behave as
    *any match* no matter what string expression is specified.

    """
    The ISharedFolder interface represents a folder in the host computer's
    file system accessible from the guest OS running inside a virtual
    machine using an associated logical name.
    
    There are three types of shared folders:
    
    *Global* (:py:func:`IVirtualBox.shared_folders` ), shared
    folders available to all virtual machines.
    *Permanent* (:py:func:`IMachine.shared_folders` ),
    VM-specific shared folders available to the given virtual machine at
    startup.
    *Transient* (:py:func:`IConsole.shared_folders` ),
    VM-specific shared folders created in the session context (for
    example, when the virtual machine is running) and automatically
    discarded when the session is closed (the VM is powered off).
    
    
    Logical names of shared folders must be unique within the given scope
    (global, permanent or transient). However, they do not need to be unique
    across scopes. In this case, the definition of the shared folder in a
    more specific scope takes precedence over definitions in all other
    scopes. The order of precedence is (more specific to more general):
    
    Transient definitions
    Permanent definitions
    Global definitions
    
    
    For example, if MyMachine has a shared folder named
    C_DRIVE (that points to C:\\), then creating a
    transient shared folder named C_DRIVE (that points
    to C:\\\\WINDOWS) will change the definition
    of C_DRIVE in the guest OS so
    that \\\\VBOXSVR\\C_DRIVE will give access
    to C:\\WINDOWS instead of C:\\ on the host
    PC. Removing the transient shared folder C_DRIVE will restore
    the previous (permanent) definition of C_DRIVE that points
    to C:\\ if it still exists.
    
    Note that permanent and transient shared folders of different machines
    are in different name spaces, so they don't overlap and don't need to
    have unique logical names.
    
    
    Global shared folders are not implemented in the current version of the

class ISession(Interface):
    """
    The ISession interface represents a client process and allows for locking
    virtual machines (represented by IMachine objects) to prevent conflicting
    changes to the machine.
    
    Any caller wishing to manipulate a virtual machine needs to create a session
    object first, which lives in its own process space. Such session objects are
    then associated with :py:class:`IMachine`  objects living in the VirtualBox
    server process to coordinate such changes.
    
    There are two typical scenarios in which sessions are used:
    
    
    To alter machine settings or control a running virtual machine, one
    needs to lock a machine for a given session (client process) by calling
    :py:func:`IMachine.lock_machine` .
    
    Whereas multiple sessions may control a running virtual machine, only
    one process can obtain a write lock on the machine to prevent conflicting
    changes. A write lock is also needed if a process wants to actually run a
    virtual machine in its own context, such as the VirtualBox GUI or
    VBoxHeadless front-ends. They must also lock a machine for their own
    sessions before they are allowed to power up the virtual machine.
    
    As a result, no machine settings can be altered while another process is
    already using it, either because that process is modifying machine settings
    or because the machine is running.
    
    
    To start a VM using one of the existing VirtualBox front-ends (e.g. the
    VirtualBox GUI or VBoxHeadless), one would use
    :py:func:`IMachine.launch_vm_process` , which also takes a session object
    as its first parameter. This session then identifies the caller and lets the
    caller control the started machine (for example, pause machine execution or
    power it down) as well as be notified about machine execution state changes.
    
    
    
    How sessions objects are created in a client process depends on whether you use
    the Main API via COM or via the webservice:
    
    
    When using the COM API directly, an object of the Session class from the
    VirtualBox type library needs to be created. In regular COM C++ client code,
    this can be done by calling createLocalObject(), a standard COM API.
    This object will then act as a local session object in further calls to open
    a session.
    
    
    In the webservice, the session manager (IWebsessionManager) instead creates
    a session object automatically whenever :py:func:`IWebsessionManager.logon` 
    is called. A managed object reference to that session object can be retrieved by
    calling :py:func:`IWebsessionManager.get_session_object` .

    VBoxSVC process terminates. Moreover, metric settings and data associated
    with a particular VM only exist while VM is running. They disappear as
    soon as VM shuts down. It is not possible to set up metrics for machines
    that are powered off. One needs to start VM first, then set up metric
    collection parameters.
    
    Metrics are organized hierarchically, with each level separated by a
    slash (/) character. Generally, the scheme for metric names is like this:
    
    Category/Metric[/SubMetric][:aggregation]
    
    "Category/Metric" together form the base metric name. A base metric is
    the smallest unit for which a sampling interval and the number of
    retained samples can be set. Only base metrics can be enabled and
    disabled. All sub-metrics are collected when their base metric is
    collected. Collected values for any set of sub-metrics can be queried
    with :py:func:`IPerformanceCollector.query_metrics_data` .
    
    For example "CPU/Load/User:avg" metric name stands for the "CPU"
    category, "Load" metric, "User" submetric, "average" aggregate. An
    aggregate function is computed over all retained data. Valid aggregate
    functions are:
    
    
    avg -- average
    min -- minimum
    max -- maximum
    
    
    When setting up metric parameters, querying metric data, enabling or
    disabling metrics wildcards can be used in metric names to specify a
    subset of metrics. For example, to select all CPU-related metrics
    use CPU/*, all averages can be queried using *:avg and
    so on. To query metric values without aggregates *: can be used.
    
    The valid names for base metrics are:
    
    
    CPU/Load
    CPU/MHz
    RAM/Usage
    RAM/VMM
    
    
    The general sequence for collecting and retrieving the metrics is:
    
    
    Obtain an instance of IPerformanceCollector with
    :py:func:`IVirtualBox.performance_collector` 
    
    
    Allocate and populate an array with references to objects the metrics
    will be collected for. Use references to IHost and IMachine objects.
    
    
    Allocate and populate an array with base metric names the data will
    be collected for.
    
    
    Call :py:func:`IPerformanceCollector.setup_metrics` . From now on
    the metric data will be collected and stored.
    
    
    Wait for the data to get collected.
    
    
    Allocate and populate an array with references to objects the metric
    values will be queried for. You can re-use the object array used for
    setting base metrics.
    
    
    Allocate and populate an array with metric names the data will be
    collected for. Note that metric names differ from base metric names.
    
    
    Call :py:func:`IPerformanceCollector.query_metrics_data` . The data
    that have been collected so far are returned. Note that the values
    are still retained internally and data collection continues.

class IEvent(Interface):
    """
    Abstract parent interface for VirtualBox events. Actual events will typically implement
    a more specific interface which derives from this (see below).
    
    **Introduction to VirtualBox events**
    
    Generally speaking, an event (represented by this interface) signals that something
    happened, while an event listener (see :py:class:`IEventListener` ) represents an
    entity that is interested in certain events. In order for this to work with
    unidirectional protocols (i.e. web services), the concepts of passive and active
    listener are used.
    
    Event consumers can register themselves as listeners, providing an array of
    events they are interested in (see :py:func:`IEventSource.register_listener` ).
    When an event triggers, the listener is notified about the event. The exact
    mechanism of the notification depends on whether the listener was registered as
    an active or passive listener:
    
    
    An active listener is very similar to a callback: it is a function invoked
    by the API. As opposed to the callbacks that were used in the API before
    VirtualBox 4.0 however, events are now objects with an interface hierarchy.
    
    
    Passive listeners are somewhat trickier to implement, but do not require
    a client function to be callable, which is not an option with scripting
    languages or web service clients. Internally the :py:class:`IEventSource` 
    implementation maintains an event queue for each passive listener, and
    newly arrived events are put in this queue. When the listener calls
    :py:func:`IEventSource.get_event` , first element from its internal event
    queue is returned. When the client completes processing of an event,
    the :py:func:`IEventSource.event_processed`  function must be called,
    acknowledging that the event was processed. It supports implementing
    waitable events. On passive listener unregistration, all events from its
    queue are auto-acknowledged.
    
    
    
    Waitable events are useful in situations where the event generator wants to track
    delivery or a party wants to wait until all listeners have completed the event. A
    typical example would be a vetoable event (see :py:class:`IVetoEvent` ) where a
    listeners might veto a certain action, and thus the event producer has to make
    sure that all listeners have processed the event and not vetoed before taking
    the action.
    
    A given event may have both passive and active listeners at the same time.
    
    **Using events**
    
    Any VirtualBox object capable of producing externally visible events provides an
    @c eventSource read-only attribute, which is of the type :py:class:`IEventSource` .
    This event source object is notified by VirtualBox once something has happened, so
    consumers may register event listeners with this event source. To register a listener,
    an object implementing the :py:class:`IEventListener`  interface must be provided.
    For active listeners, such an object is typically created by the consumer, while for
    passive listeners :py:func:`IEventSource.create_listener`  should be used. Please
    note that a listener created with :py:func:`IEventSource.create_listener`  must not be used as an active listener.
    
    Once created, the listener must be registered to listen for the desired events
    (see :py:func:`IEventSource.register_listener` ), providing an array of
    :py:class:`VBoxEventType`  enums. Those elements can either be the individual
    event IDs or wildcards matching multiple event IDs.
    
    After registration, the callback's :py:func:`IEventListener.handle_event`  method is
    called automatically when the event is triggered, while passive listeners have to call
    :py:func:`IEventSource.get_event`  and :py:func:`IEventSource.event_processed`  in
    an event processing loop.
    
    The IEvent interface is an abstract parent interface for all such VirtualBox events
    coming in. As a result, the standard use pattern inside :py:func:`IEventListener.handle_event` 
    or the event processing loop is to check the :py:func:`type_p`  attribute of the event and
    then cast to the appropriate specific interface using @c QueryInterface().

    Notification when an error happens during the virtual

    There are three kinds of runtime errors:
    
    *fatal*
    *non-fatal with retry*
    *non-fatal warnings*
    
    
    **Fatal** errors are indicated by the @a fatal parameter set
    to @c true. In case of fatal errors, the virtual machine
    execution is always paused before calling this notification, and
    the notification handler is supposed either to immediately save
    the virtual machine state using :py:func:`IMachine.save_state` 
    or power it off using :py:func:`IConsole.power_down` .
    Resuming the execution can lead to unpredictable results.
    
    **Non-fatal** errors and warnings are indicated by the
    @a fatal parameter set to @c false. If the virtual machine
    is in the Paused state by the time the error notification is
    received, it means that the user can *try to resume* the machine
    execution after attempting to solve the problem that caused the
    error. In this case, the notification handler is supposed
    to show an appropriate message to the user (depending on the
    value of the @a id parameter) that offers several actions such
    as *Retry*, *Save* or *Power Off*. If the user
    wants to retry, the notification handler should continue
    the machine execution using the :py:func:`IConsole.resume` 
    call. If the machine execution is not Paused during this
    notification, then it means this notification is a *warning*
    (for example, about a fatal condition that can happen very soon);
    no immediate action is required from the user, the machine
    continues its normal execution.
    
    Note that in either case the notification handler
    **must not** perform any action directly on a thread
    where this notification is called. Everything it is allowed to
    do is to post a message to another thread that will then talk
    to the user and take the corresponding action.
